### Synopsis

The humble `<div>` is a powerful and flexible element. Throw enough CSS and JavaScript on it, and a can be anything. 
But should it be? “Semantic HTML” is a method of using elements that best match what your content means and does. 
But how do you write better markup if you don’t know your options? Join the learning journey to fill your semantic HTML toolkit with the coolest elements you never knew existed. Learn specific elements to use in different scenarios and how to wield the full power of the HTML spec. You’ll write less code while making your pages more accessible and mobile-friendly!

### Notes

* Semantic HTML: Choosing elements based on their meaning
* Non-Semantic HTML: Choosing elements based on browser styles and/or using `<div>` for everything
* Keeps readable layout even if styles are missing or JavaScript is disabled
* Page is still functional (e.g. forms can submit)
* Improves accessibility
* More context with less code
* Why _Not_ Semantic HTML?
  * Element not supported across browsers
  * Specific UX/UI needs
  * You are willing to implement, test, and ensure accessibility of custom alternative
    * Does a library already exist, can I contribute?
    * Accessible?
    * Browser compatibility?
    * Mobile devices?
    * How hard is it to test & maintain?
