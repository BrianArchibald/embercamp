### Synopsis

The humble `<div>` is a powerful and flexible element. Throw enough CSS and JavaScript on it, and a can be anything. 
But should it be? “Semantic HTML” is a method of using elements that best match what your content means and does. 
But how do you write better markup if you don’t know your options? Join the learning journey to fill your semantic HTML toolkit with the coolest elements you never knew existed. Learn specific elements to use in different scenarios and how to wield the full power of the HTML spec. You’ll write less code while making your pages more accessible and mobile-friendly!

### Speaker Bio

She is passionate about creating inclusive experiences and understanding foundational web technologies at a deeper level. Talk to her about rock climbing or Texas!

### Notes

* Semantic HTML: Choosing elements based on their meaning
* Non-Semantic HTML: Choosing elements based on browser styles and/or using `<div>` for everything
* Keeps readable layout even if styles are missing or JavaScript is disabled
* Page is still functional (e.g. forms can submit)
* Improves accessibility
* More context with less code
* Why _Not_ Semantic HTML?
  * Element not supported across browsers
  * Specific UX/UI needs
  * You are willing to implement, test, and ensure accessibility of custom alternative
    * Does a library already exist, can I contribute?
    * Accessible?
    * Browser compatibility?
    * Mobile devices?
    * How hard is it to test & maintain?

#### Semantic Elements

* `<main>`
* `<article>`
* `<section>`

* `<figure>`
* `<figcaption>`
* `<video>`
  * Format support varies by browser
* `<track>`

### Bio

He is thankful every day that he bet his company on Ember, and is more excited than ever about where things headed. When not working, or parenting, or programming, Sean enjoys running, cycling, and the NBA.

### Notes

> "Unless you have a large and sustainable development budget and are competing in a market where the user is the buyer and there is significant competition with feature parity, a hybrid mobile-first app is almost certainly your best option."

Conclusion: Almost everyone should be using [EmberJS](https://emberjs.com) and [Corber](http://corber.io/)!

How did XBE decide on their tech stack?

* Situation
  * People often have opinions about tech stacks without knowing any context the app will be built in
  * Diverse User Base
  * Broad & Deep Functionality
  * Bootstrapped, Small Team
  * Location-Centric Requirements
  * User/Buyer Dichotomy
  * Compulsory Usage
* Objective
  * Maximize: Leverage
  * Constraint: Location Tracking Requirement
  * Constraint: Bootstrapped Budget
* Options
  * Mobile-first web app with native tracking apps 
    * Viable
  * Hybrid mobile-first app
    * Viable
  * Multiple "native" apps with feature parity
    * Shockingly, this is the default choice of most companies
      * Featuresets almost never stay in sync across platforms
    * Non-viable: Too expensive
      * Larger/venture-backed companies can trick themselves into thinking this option is best b/c cost isn't a constraint
  * Mobile web only
    * Non-viable: Inadequate location tracking
* Decision
  * Mobile-first
  * Web-first
  * Responsible design
  * ??? (missed a fourth point in the slides - please add)
* Development
  * Build an app that "feels" right on a phone is the biggest challenge
  * Corber config and build process feels opaque and magical
  * Native app release process is cumbersome and manual
  * ___If you build a solid mobile-first web app with Ember, the native apps come for free___
* Missed Slide ???
* Implications
  * Know your situation and objective
  * Accept your constraints
  * Understand options in terms of your context
* _Maturity: Accepting What Is True And Acting Accordingly_
