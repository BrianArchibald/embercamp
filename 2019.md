#### Synopsis

The humble `<div>` is a powerful and flexible element. Throw enough CSS and JavaScript on it, and a can be anything. 
But should it be? “Semantic HTML” is a method of using elements that best match what your content means and does. 
But how do you write better markup if you don’t know your options? Join the learning journey to fill your semantic HTML toolkit with the coolest elements you never knew existed. Learn specific elements to use in different scenarios and how to wield the full power of the HTML spec. You’ll write less code while making your pages more accessible and mobile-friendly!

### Notes

* Semantic HTML: Choosing elements based on their meaning
* Non-Semantic HTML: Choosing elements based on browser styles and/or using `<div>` for everything
* Keeps readable layout even if styles are missing or JavaScript is disabled
* Page is still functional (e.g. forms can submit)
* Improves accessibility
* More context with less code
* Why _Not_ Semantic HTML?
  * Element not supported across browsers
  * Specific UX/UI needs
  * You are willing to implement, test, and ensure accessibility of custom alternative
    * Does a library already exist, can I contribute?
    * Accessible?
    * Browser compatibility?
    * Mobile devices?
    * How hard is it to test & maintain?

##### Semantic Elements

* `<main>`
* `<article>`
* `<section>`
* `<aside>`
* `<nav>`
* `<header>`
* `<footer>`
* `<forms>`
* `<fieldset>`
* `<legend>`
* `<input>`
  * Supports many different types -
  * Basic: checkbox, number, radio, range, text
  * Formatted: email, tel, url

  * Form Controls: button, hidden, image, reset, submit
  * Special: color, file, password, search
* `<select>`
* `<option>`
* `<optgroup>`
* `<output>`
  * Unsupported by IE (won't break the site, just won't give you aria stuff)
* `<figure>`
* `<figcaption>`
* `<video>`
  * Format support varies by browser
* `<track>`

* `<audio>`
  * Most browsers don't support `<track>` inside this element, but if you put `<audio>` inside `<video>`, it can work
* Text Formatting

  * `<code>`
    * Executable code
  * `<samp>`

  * `<abbr>`
  * `<dfn>`
  * `<address>`
  * `<time>`

### Notes

> "Unless you have a large and sustainable development budget and are competing in a market where the user is the buyer and there is significant competition with feature parity, a hybrid mobile-first app is almost certainly your best option."

Conclusion: Almost everyone should be using [EmberJS](https://emberjs.com) and [Corber](http://corber.io/)!

How did XBE decide on their tech stack?

* Situation
  * People often have opinions about tech stacks without knowing any context the app will be built in
  * Diverse User Base
  * Broad & Deep Functionality
  * Bootstrapped, Small Team
  * Location-Centric Requirements
  * User/Buyer Dichotomy
  * Compulsory Usage
* Objective
  * Maximize: Leverage
  * Constraint: Location Tracking Requirement
  * Constraint: Bootstrapped Budget
* Options
  * Mobile-first web app with native tracking apps 
    * Viable
  * Hybrid mobile-first app
    * Viable
  * Multiple "native" apps with feature parity
    * Shockingly, this is the default choice of most companies
      * Featuresets almost never stay in sync across platforms
    * Non-viable: Too expensive
      * Larger/venture-backed companies can trick themselves into thinking this option is best b/c cost isn't a constraint
  * Mobile web only
    * Non-viable: Inadequate location tracking
* Decision
  * Mobile-first
  * Web-first
  * Responsible design
  * ??? (missed a fourth point in the slides - please add)
* Development
  * Build an app that "feels" right on a phone is the biggest challenge
  * Corber config and build process feels opaque and magical
  * Native app release process is cumbersome and manual
  * ___If you build a solid mobile-first web app with Ember, the native apps come for free___
* Missed Slide ???
* Implications
  * Know your situation and objective
  * Accept your constraints
  * Understand options in terms of your context
* _Maturity: Accepting What Is True And Acting Accordingly_
  
Note: This talk had lots of fun asphalt-related trivia not captured here.

## Worker Power!

* Speaker: __[Dan Gebhardt](https://twitter.com/dgeb)__ ([GitHub](https://github.com/dgeb))
* [Resources](http://bit.ly/ember-workers)

#### Synopsis

Web workers bring a new layer of capabilities to web applications. Because workers operate on their own threads, they provide a way to perform processor-intensive tasks without affecting the responsiveness of an application. This talk will explore the different types of workers, including service workers and shared workers, and how to make the most of them in your Ember applications. We'll discuss the capabilities available to workers and explore different use cases, including progressive web apps.

#### Bio

Dan is on the Ember.js core team, an editor of the JSON:API spec, and the creator of Orbit.js. He consults through Cerebris, the company he co-founded, and their partner Tilde. He loves to travel and hike with his family and fluffy dog.

### Notes

"This really is a talk about the power of organized labor"

* Web Workers
  * Dedicated
  * Shared
  * Service
* Main Thread: All processing done on the web happens here by default
* Workers are the only threading primitive on the web
  * Offload processing work to workers so that it can occur in parallel
* "Concurrency is about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of things at once." - Rob Pike (Go Creator)
* What happens when we exceed the limits of concurrency on the main thread? __Jank.__
  * Things seem off when apps drop below 60 fps, meaning browsers need to repaint every 15 ms
* Perceived challenges to using workers
  * New and unproven? No, they've been around since 2012
  * Lack of browser support? No, widely supported by browsers
  * Lack of capabilities? No, give access to nearly every browser API
* Real challenges to using workers
  * Awkward to use
  * Awkward to test
  * Lack of FE framework support
  * All challenges are developer experience problems
* Characteristics of all workers
  * Async communication
  * No shared memory
  * Controlled lifetime
  * Access to browsers APIs
  * No direct access to DOM
* Dedicated Workers
  * Global browser support: High 90s percentile, even IE/Edge
  * Supports ES modules
  * Demo: Calculate fibonacci sequence of numbers in worker so that UI is not blocked
* Shared Workers
  * ~36% global browser availability: Not yet supported in safari/edge/IE
  * MessagePort
  * Same demo, running in multiple browser windows
    * Data synced across window via the shared worker
    * Each window has its own store, but they're communicating via shared memory of the worker
    * Built with OrbitJS & EmberJS
* Service Workers
  * Popular for building complete offline experiences
  * Global browser support: High 90s percentile, no IE support
  * Progressive Web App (PWA) Checklist
    * Site is served over HTTPs
    * Responsive
    * ??? More items (please add)
  * Can even customize response to `fetch`
* DX Improvements
  * __ember-workers__ (Upcoming addon!)
    * Uses rollup under the hood for tree-shaking, ES module support across all browsers, etc
    * Makes workers accessible everywhere
  * [promise-worker](https://github.com/nolanlawson/promise-worker)
    * Problem: Evented async can get awkward
    * This NPM package wraps Evented code in promise syntax for async/await
  * testing
    * Write modular code
    * Unit test your modules (w/o workers)
    * Stub workers in your tests
    * [worker-box](https://github.com/trentmwillis/worker-box)
      * Toolbox for stubbing web workers

## Compiling Ember

* Speaker: __[Ed Faulkner](https://twitter.com/eaf4)__ ([GitHub](https://github.com/ef4))

#### Synopsis

Compilers have a reputation for being esoteric and intimidating. But they don't need to be! A compiler is just a program that writes programs. This talk will be a practical tour through the Embroider build system that also teaches compiler concepts along the way. With the power of multi-pass compilation, Embroider can take a long-lived, conventional Ember app and give it lazy loading, code splitting, and tree shaking. All without modifying the app's own code.
